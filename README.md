## Installation

### End-User Installation

Install and launch the Tray Application in one step:

```bash
pip install jobops
jobops
```

Or zero-install via uvx:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# Use the latest stable version
uvx --from https://github.com/codesapienbe/jobops/releases/download/v2025.06.27.1409/jobops-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl 
```

### Developer Setup

```bash
pip install uv
uv pip install -e .
```

---

## Module Build Steps


### 0. Jobops CLI (Parent project)

```bash
uv sync
uv pip install -e .
# Build wheel (optional, for distribution)
uv build --out-dir ../../dist/jobops_cli/
# back to the parent dir
```


### 1. JobOps API (FastAPI Backend)

```bash
cd src/jobops_api
uv sync
uv pip install -e .
# Build wheel (optional, for distribution)
uv build --out-dir ../../dist/jobops_api/
# back to the parent dir
cd -
```

- Output: `dist/jobops_api/`

### 2. JobOps Tray (Tray Application)

```bash
cd src/jobops_tray
uv sync
uv pip install -e .
# Build wheel (optional, for distribution)
uv build --out-dir ../../dist/jobops_tray/
# back to the parent dir
cd -
```

- Output: `dist/jobops_tray/`

### 3. JobOps Clipper (Chrome Extension)

```bash
cd src/jobops_clipper
npm install
npm run build
# back to the parent dir
cd -
```

- Output: `dist/jobops_clipper/` (at project root)

---


## Configuration

Configure AI backends, templates, and repository paths in:

- `~/.jobops/config.yml`
- Environment variables: `JOBOPS_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `JOBOPS_OLLAMA_PORT`, etc.

---

## Required API Port Configuration

The JobOps API **requires** the environment variable `JOBOPS_API_PORT` to be set before starting the API server or using the CLI to launch the API. There is **no default port**; you must specify the port explicitly via the environment variable.

### Example Usage

```bash
export JOBOPS_API_PORT=8081
jobops  # or python -m jobops_api
```

If `JOBOPS_API_PORT` is not set or is not a valid integer, the API and CLI will raise an error and refuse to start.

- **Error if not set:**
  - `RuntimeError: Environment variable JOBOPS_API_PORT must be set (no default port allowed).`
- **Error if not integer:**
  - `RuntimeError: JOBOPS_API_PORT must be an integer, got: <value>`

Set this variable in your shell or environment before running JobOps services.

## Threat Model

This section summarizes key assets, data flows, threats, and mitigations for JobOps (Tray + API) and the JobOps Clipper (extension).

### Assets
- User job data (clipped content, metadata)
- Credentials/API keys (Groq, Linear)
- Local IndexedDB database (extension)
- Application binaries and build artifacts

### Trust Boundaries
- Browser Extension sandbox (MV3 service worker, popup)
- Local storage (Chrome sync storage, IndexedDB)
- Network calls to: Backend API, Groq, Linear, Translation APIs
- User workstation and OS

### Data Flows
1. Clipper: Page ‚Üí Content Script ‚Üí Popup ‚Üí IndexedDB (local)
2. Optional: Popup ‚Üí Groq/Ollama for analysis (user consent required)
3. Optional: Popup ‚Üí Linear (task creation)
4. Extension ‚Üí Backend API (clip persistence when invoked)

### Threats (STRIDE)
- Spoofing: Malicious pages mimicking job boards; stolen API keys
- Tampering: Content script manipulation; DB data corruption
- Repudiation: Lack of audit for exports
- Information Disclosure: Leaking PII, secrets, or job data
- Denial of Service: Excessive network calls; UI hangs with large logs
- Elevation of Privilege: Over-broad host permissions; content injection

### Mitigations
- Permissions minimization: activeTab + optional_host_permissions; no `<all_urls>` auto-injection
- CSP: Strict CSP in popup; no inline scripts/styles; `object-src 'none'`
- Sanitization: DOMPurify for HTML, `textContent` for dynamic text
- Secrets: Stored only in Chrome sync storage; masked in UI; never logged; PII redaction in logs
- Consent: Explicit toggle before sending to Groq/Linear; native notifications
- Encryption: Optional AES-GCM encryption of IndexedDB payloads, PBKDF2-derived key; passphrase not stored
- Reliability: Retry with backoff for Linear 429/5xx; duplicate-export guard; export-in-progress guard
- Observability: Structured logs in console; partial-failure surfacing for subtasks

### Residual Risks
- User‚Äôs machine compromise can expose session secrets and local data
- Network attackers if TLS is broken on third-party endpoints
- Supply chain risk of dependencies (esbuild, dompurify)

### Operational Guidance
- Rotate API keys periodically and on suspicion of compromise
- Prefer local LLM (Ollama) when feasible for sensitive data
- Keep browser and OS up to date; enable full-disk encryption
- Review extension permissions at install time; load unpacked builds from trusted source only
